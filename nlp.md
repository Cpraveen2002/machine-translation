## Machine Translation ?

```
- Machine translation is the process of automatically translate text from one language to another without human involvement

- In a machine translation task, the input already consists of a sequence of symbols in some language, and the computer program must convert this into a sequence of symbols in another language
```

### Real-Time Text-to-Text Translation

- Facebook has been experimenting with machine translation for close to a decade. It launched theTranslations app back in 2008, which used basic machine learning methods and crowd-sourced translations from its users to study and implement machine translation for its entire website.

### Consumer Machine Translation Applications

- Google first announced the launch of Google Translate over a decade ago. Since then, it has consistently advanced to include speech recognition and image recognition technologies for translation. Most recently, the company launched the Google Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT).
